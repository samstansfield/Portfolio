# Certificate in Programming and Development

I decided to take on the certificate program in order to update my computer skills.  I've been coding for most of my life but mostly in Fortran until relatively recently (although I did do extensive work with MATHCAD and MAPLE for creating homeowrk solutions for Physics students).  I took the introduction to Java course in 2010 and the remainder of the courses starting in 2019.  During the time of the working on the certificate I added C++ to my programming skill as well as MYSQL.  There was also work with WEB development, all of the files needed to run a static web page are here (The Climate Site).  The site may be viewed by pasting https://samstansfield.github.io into a browser.  There was one more course which is not included here.  It didn't have any programs.  There was one more class that is not included here:  IT2700,  System Analysis and Design.  There were no programs for it.
