# Certificate in Programming and Development

I decided to take on the certificate program in order to update my computer skills.  I've been coding for most of my life but mostly in Fortran until relatively recently.  I took the introduction to Java course in 2010 and the remainder of the courses starting in 2019.  During the time of the working on the certificate I added C++ to my programming skill as well as MYSQL.  There was also work with WEB development, all of the files needed to run a static web page are here.  The site may be viewed by pasting https:/samstansfield.github.io into a browswer.
