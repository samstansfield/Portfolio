# IT2660 Data Structures and Algorithms

The title of the course is self explanatory.  All programs are in Java. I'm including five programs here.  Each zip file contains all the Java files for a particular program and a .docx fille which contains the output of the program and some commentary.  In the document file, the input to the program is in blue, the output in black and the commentary in red.


The PostfixEvaluator takes a postfix expression and evaluates it. This requires the use of a "stack" data structure.

The PalindromeCheck takes a string and checks if it is a palindrome, ignoring spaces (reads the same backwards and forwards).  This requires a "queue" data structure.

The SudokuBacktracking program solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

The StudentBinaryTreeArray uses a "Student" node which contains basic information about a student and sorts them using a tree sort implemented on an array.

The SortTest program compares the sorting time for three different sorting methods.  It uses a set of randomly selected Student nodes.
