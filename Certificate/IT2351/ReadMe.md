# IT2351 Enterprise Database Systems

This is a course in MYSQL.  This is a commonly used scripting language for creating and accessing a database. I'm including only the capstone project from the course which was to create a database along with some scripts for managing it.  I decided to create a database that contains genealogical information.  The files include the scripts for creating the database, and those which are needed to add an remove documents.  

The important things about genealogy is documenting the three main things:  Births, Marriages and Deaths.  The main table here is the "Persons" tables with secondary tables with the documented life occurences.  There will be another table added called "Families"  which is quite complicated because of the many-to-many relationships that it creates in the Persons table.
