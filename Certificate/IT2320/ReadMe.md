# IT2320 Javascript Programming

In this course we learned how to use Javascript to enhance a web page.  This allows one to do more with formatting and also allows for calculations and web-form design that are not really part of html.  The important thing about Javascript is that all calculations are done Client Side without the need for the Client to send a request to the server and wait for a response.

There are five programs included here.  Each in a .zip file.  Inside the zip file are all the files needed to run the program along with screenshots that show the results (not all have screenshots).  Note that Lab 5 does not function correctly.  We had a server to submit it to which is not active anymore.  The buttons in Lab 9 only function correctly once, it needs to be reloaded to try again.
