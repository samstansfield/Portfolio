# IT2670 C++ Programming

I took this class because of the importance of C and C++.  The programs were simple, for the most part.  I only include the last program.  It calculates the areas for several different kinds of shapes.  Because of the way we were supposed to submit assignments there is only one program file and one include file.  If I were doing this on my own I would separate all of the methods by class to keep files more compact.  Long lists of methods in one file make program development more complex.  

Overall, adding C++ to the list of languages I know how to use was a good idea, it was not required for the certificate.  the importance of C and C++ large scale computing cannot be underestimated.  Java is easy to use but for large programs it is slow.  This is because it relies on the JVM for execution of programs.  This makes it an interpreted language, these are always slower than something which is exectuted directly once the program is built.  C and C++ do not have this limitation.  They are also quite close to machine code.  To me, the avantage of C++ is that it is an object oriented language.  In my opinion Object Oriented Design is one of the best innovations in computer coding in decades.
