# IT2030 ASP-NET Core MVC programming

Despite the relatively small course number this is considered the "capstone" course for the certficate in Programming and Development.  ASP-NET Core MVC is a methodology for server-side web programming.  I've included only one program from the course.  It is mostly written in C# and all tests were run on a KESTRAL server.  I've included some screenshots as well from the test runs.

MVC stands for "Model-View-Controller".  This is a pattern for server-side programming.  Briefly, the Models are C# classes that allow one to attach to a database.  They contain all the information for construction and accessing the database.  Models are also used for other things like modelling form data from an html form.  A View is a cshtml file which is mostly html but allows for the insertion or modification of html elements using C# commands.  The controllers tell the server how to process user requests and what html file to return in response.
