# IT1150 Introduction to WEB programming.

The course covers HTML and CSS.  The only program here from this course is the final project which is a static web site..  All of the files are in the samstansfield.githib.io folder.  The Site may be viewed by pasting: https://samstansfeidl.github.io into a browswer.  Github does not allow me to paste a link into a ReadMe file.
