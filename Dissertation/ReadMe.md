# My Dissertation

The programs here are written in ANSI Standard Fortran-77.  There are three programs that are part of the project.  Basdically, I start with a particular Schroedinger equation in three dimensions that separates in a parabolic coordicnate system.  The potential used is a combination of a particular anisotropic harmonic oscillator and a Coulomb potential.  The anisoptropy of the Harmonic Osillator is 2:1 where the oscillator frequency in the "z" direction is twice the frequency in the "x-y plane".  It is reasonable remarkable that this equation separates in these coordinates.
