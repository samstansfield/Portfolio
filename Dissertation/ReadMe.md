# My Dissertation

The programs here are written in ANSI Standard Fortran-77.  There are three programs that are part of the project.  Basdically, I start with a particular Schroedinger equation in three dimensions that separates in a Parabolic coordinate system.  The potential used is a combination of a particular anisotropic harmonic oscillator and a Coulomb potential.  The anisoptropy of the Harmonic Osillator is 2:1 where the oscillator frequency in the "z" direction is twice the frequency in the "x-y plane".  It is reasonable remarkable that this equation separates in these coordinates.  All of the eigenvalues are discrete.

The separated equations are identical except for constants which are related to the eigenvalues and the relative strength of the Coulomb potential.  The eigenvalue equations cannot be soleved using standard techniques that are used for finding eigenvalues of differential equations.  The main reason for this is the basic fact that the reduced Ordinary Differential Equations (reduced in the sense that the assymptotic behavior has been factored out of the wave functions) give three-term recurrence relations and as such finding the eigenvalues cannot be done by standard techniques.

When the Coulomb potential is "switched off" the resulting problem is a pure harmonic oscillator.  It does separate in cylindrical coordinates, the resulting solutions are Laguerre and Hermite Polynomials.  When separated in Parabolic coordinates the three-term recurrence relations still apply.

For each of the separated equations in Parabolic coordinates the resulting equations have two eigenvalues.  Since there are two equations the goal is to find pairs of eigenvalues that allow one to find pairs of functions that satisfy the boundary conditions. The two eigenvalues can be listed as the "Energy" (scaled to be dimensionless) and a second eigenvalue called "lambda" which is an eigenvalue of the "z-cpmponent" of a generalization of the "Lenz" vector for the Coulomb potential.  For the combined problem where the Coulomb potential is switched on there is at most a two-fold degeneracy of the energy eigenvalue.  For the pure oscillator case there is more energy degeneracy which may be uncovered by examining the separation in Cylindrical coordinates.

The first program calculates the "lambda" eigenvalues for the pure oscillator case.  This could be done using standard routines for diagonalizing a tri-diagonal matrix.  Instead a continued fraction of finite length is constructed from the recurrence relation.  It terminates because the energies are oscillator energies.  For the combined case it would have infinite length, in that case using it for computation doesn't work well.  The roots are found by adjusting the lambda values and looking for sign changes.  When one is found the correct result can be zeroed in on.  Like the combined case this method also must deal with the fact that sign changes may occur at infinities.  The progam also calculates some results when the "Stark" term is non zero.  This term results from a uniform Electric Field in the "z" direction.  It does also find all lambda values corresponding to a specific energy.  Note that when a Stark term is present the energies are shifted but not split so that the energy degeneracies are the same as in the case with no Stark term.

For the combined problem the infinite series do not terminate.  It's not hard to show that they do converge so that the resulting wave functions are finite.  The second program finds values of the two eigenvalues for which the resulting series do converge.  It uses the form of the equations where the behavior at the origin has been extracted (of the form x^n for n an integer that depends on the z-cponent of angular momentuem) but not the long distance behavior which is a Gaussian (because of the fact that the Harmonic Oscillator potential dominates at large distances).  It uses fourth order Runge-Kutta integration to integrate the equation starting at large distances and attempts to find a function where the derivative at the origin is zero.  Each pass changes the value of "lambda" until a suitable function is found and the eigenvalue pair is saved.  The result of this program is a set of curves in the eigenvalue plane where the integrated function satisfies the boundary conditions.  One of the complications of the program is that between every pair of curves where the derivative is zero at the origin is a curve where it is infinite.  These ininities correspond to "irregular" solutions of the equation.

The third program is not included here.  It takes the data files produced by the second program and produces graphs that show the curves.  Energy is measured vertically and "lambda" is measured horizontally.  To find the solutions one takes curves that are moving upward and flip them over to find curves that move downwards.  The combined eigenvalues are where a set of upward and downward moving curves cross.  Calculating the crossings is quite challenging becuase of the infinities mentioned above.  I've included some images that illustrate the crossings with zero z-compnent of angular momentum.
