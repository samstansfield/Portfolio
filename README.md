# Portfolio

This is my portfolio of programs.  It is by no means complete.  It does show some of the major programs I have written.  In general these are in three folders.  The first folder is programs from my PhD Dissertaion.  The second is programs from the Certificate in Programming and Development I completed at Cuyahoga Community College in 2022.  The third folder contains a work in prograss, creating a Java class that will handle arithmetic in Finite Fields.  The first part of it is complete (Prime Fields) but the rest is not yet complete.
