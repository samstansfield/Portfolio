# Finite Fields

Finite fields are an important mathematical construct.  They are used in some aspects of pure mathematics, like Group Theory.  More importantly they are used in cryptography.  The reason for this is that while finding a power (exponentiation) of an element is easy, it is difficult to impossible to calculate a finite logarithm in a reasonable amount of processing time.

Briefly, a finite field is a finite set of elements that are closed under all four arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division).  A typical finite field also has a zero(0) so that 0+x=x+0=x and a unit(1) so that 1*x=x*1 = x for all x in the field.  All of the usual commutative, associative and distributive laws apply.  Division by zero is forbidden.

Computationally, Addition, Subtraction (vector addition mod(p)) are simple but Multiplicatiion and Division are somewhat tricky.  The order (number of elements) of a Finite Field is always p^n where p is a prime number and n is any positive integer.  The p^n elements are vectors of dimension n over a field of order p.  In cryptography, one often chooses a large prime as a starting point.  There has also been some use of the Finite Field of order 2^6 =64.  The construction of non-prime order fields does require the use of an irreducible polynomial of degree n+1 (irreducible in the sense that it cannot be solved over the field of order p) the coefficients of the polynomial must be in the "prime field", it generally chosen to be monic (all coeffients 0, +1 or -1) but this is not a requirement.  The construction of the multiplication and division tables do rely on this polynomial, although fields of the same order resulting from different polynomials are isomorphic and the specific tables look different.  All of the (non-zero) elements of the field are powers of a single element called the generator so that the field itself is cyclic under multiplication.  In some fields any element besides 0 and 1 can be a generator but in many this is not true (it depends if p^n-1 is prime or not).

As of right now, the program that works with Prime Fields (fields of order p) is complete and working correctly.  The full program for fields of order p^n is still in progress.  All of the current versions of the various class files are included.  In order to use the PrimeField program one needs the PrimeField class, the two exception classes, the MathFields interface and the FiniteField test class.
